# Hi there :wave:
It's a pleasure to meet you! I am Till and welcome to my personal place on the web.

After studying Computer Science at [University of Applied Sciences Landshut](https://www.haw-landshut.de/)
I started working as a Software Engineer at IoT company [HiveMQ](hivemq.com).
Presently, my days are filled with developing new features for the HiveMQ MQTT broker. 
Prior to this, I developed the open-source MQTT command line interface, [mqtt-cli](https://github.com/hivemq/mqtt-cli), 
a project I help to maintain to this day.

Beyond my work, I am also exploring the realms of Machine Learning and Data Science by completing various courses,
reading and watching a lot of [StatQuest](https://www.youtube.com/c/joshstarmer) and [3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/@3blue1brown).

When I step away from the screen, you'll often find me scaling boulders, training for a new run or exploring new places,
whether it's by hiking, road tripping or sailing. From time to time, I also like to kick back and read some fantasy
or play the guitar.

Feel free to look around and get in [touch](mailto:seebergertill@gmail.com)! \:\)
